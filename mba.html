            <ul>
                <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> People who are in charge of marketing the goods or services of any organization need to be able to create effective marketing strategies and convey their message to people efficiently. An MBA program equips its students with theoretical knowledge as well as practical marketing skills, which can help in getting jobs in the marketing field. With the MBA degree, you can look to become no less than a product manager responsible for marketing.</li>
                <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Those in the field of finance need to be quick thinkers, have high energy levels to stay abreast of the financial markets, and most importantly, need to have patience to deal with clients and explain things to them.

                <li><strong>Government Jobs:</strong> People often live with the misconception that an MBA degree is only good for business because of its very name. But it can be very useful for a career in a government agency. Such jobs usually require you to be a big thinker and to be a team player. All this and more is learned in an MBA program. Government agencies have since long had a reputation of giving reactive responses that do not much translate into action.

                <li><strong>Non-profit Organizations:</strong> An MBA degree can open up many jobs for you in non-profit organizations. Most people with this degree or those who are still pursuing this degree, do not give much thought to jobs in the non-profit sector as it is regarded as a ‘waste’ of their skills and abilities. But on the contrary, this is one sector that could benefit a great deal from having more people with MBAs involved in non-profit. As for the MBA graduate, it can be very rewarding, both financially and emotionally, to see that your talents are making a positive difference in the lives of many people. You get the chance to work for a worthy cause, while at the same time furthering your own career.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This is just the tip of the iceberg as far as career opportunities for MBAs are concerned. Having an MBA degree gives you countless job opportunities, mostly in top level positions, and can help to further your career tremendously.</p>
