        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The magnificence of Electronics and Communication lies in its ubiquity! Electronic devices have become a major part of our lives. With the evolution of technology, Electronics and Communication has become an essential discipline that is required by every other industry. Now the world can no longer undermine the significance that Electronics and Communication discipline carries. Hence, Electronics and Communication engineering is one of the most sought-after branches by students.</p>
        <p>Electronics is fundamental to many of the things we take for granted today. Everything from mobile phones to aircraft and medical equipment relies on electronics, and it is difficult to think of any area of life that has not been affected by developments in electronics. Technology, and particularly electronics, is developing at a more rapid pace than ever before. This makes the job of the Electronic Engineer both exciting and challenging, but it also means that there are great rewards for engineers, both in terms of remuneration and job satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Electronics and Communication plays an important role in almost every sphere of our life. It has penetrated in every field of our existence. It mainly deals with the communication technologies along with the basic electronic components, design of circuits and systems. The Electronics and Communication department is established with well-equipped laboratories and research facilities. These laboratories provide a platform for learning not only theory but also practical aspects of electronics and communication engineering.</p>
        
        <h3>Duration of the Course</h3>
        <p>The course lasts for 4 Years. As a part of the Engineering curriculum, students study Engineering Mathematics, Elements of Mechanical Engineering, CAED, Professional Ethics, and programming concepts during the first-year foundational courses. In the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years, focus will be on core ECE specialized subjects such as Analog Electronic Circuits, Digital Electronics, Signal Processing, Analog and Digital Communication, VLSI and Embedded Systems, Artificial Intelligence, etc., followed by project work and technical seminars.</p>

        <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Competent professionals in the field of Electronics and Communication Engineering to pursue careers in diverse fields and higher education.</li>
            <li>Proficient in designing innovative solutions to real-life problems that are technically sound, economically viable, and socially acceptable.</li>
            <li>Capable of working in teams and adapting to new technologies as per society needs with ethical values.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Facilities</h3>
        <p>The department has 11 laboratories with equipment like digital trainer kits, oscilloscopes, signal generators, power supply units, interface kits, and software like Xilinx, Mentor Graphics, Keil, Matlab for VLSI, DSP, microprocessor, and microcontroller labs. The computer terminals are connected to Windows 200/ Linux servers having individual hard disks. These are Windows Vista/Xp bootable. The department is well equipped with all the necessary software required to carry out project work. These facilities are exclusively for undergraduate and postgraduate students of Electronics and Communication Engineering.</p>
