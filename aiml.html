        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Four year B.E. undergraduate course in Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML) is designed to inculcate technically sound knowledge in advanced learning systems that are based on algorithms of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. AI is changing the way we work and live. AI is already creating tremendous amounts of value into the software industry and in sectors such as retail, travel, transportation, automotive, materials, manufacturing and so on. Understanding AI and knowing how to create AI powered applications gives you an edge in your career.</p>
        <p>AI is about teaching the machines to learn, act and think as humans. It is the application of computing to solve problems in an intelligent way using algorithms. AI systems typically demonstrate behaviours associated with human intelligence such as planning, learning, reasoning, problem-solving, knowledge representation, perception, psychology, manipulation, social intelligence and creativity.</p>
        <p>Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based on what it has learned, without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms are trained with large sets of data and programmed to learn from examples. Machines do not follow rule-based algorithms. Machine learning is what enables machines to solve problems on their own and make accurate predictions using the provided data.</p>
