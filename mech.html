        <h2>Why Mechanical Engineering?</h2>
        <p>Mechanical engineering is a assorted branch of engineering which draws its wings from the necessitate to conceptualize and design to the manufacture stage. The skill-sets required by a mechanical engineer is not just limited to the above design and manufacturing processes, but also in the analytical skills and quality maintenance. The mechanical engineer needs to acquire particular skills and knowledge with respect to the developments and advancements in the technology prevalent in the engineering sector. As a mechanical engineer, one needs to analyze the working product for its life cycle in various industries such as thermal environment, chemical environment, apart from the intense stresses generated due to the various other working conditions. Apart from these, designing a product for its functionality, aesthetics and cost also carries equal weightage for a mechanical engineer. Since these skills are required for virtually everything that is made, mechanical engineering is perhaps the broadest and most diverse of engineering disciplines. Mechanical engineers play a central role in such industries as automotive, aerospace, biotechnology, computers and electronics, microelectromechanical systems or MEMS, energy conversion, environmental control, automation, manufacturing. To put it simply, mechanical engineering deals with anything that moves, including the human body.</p>
