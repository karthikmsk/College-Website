        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Our modern world would be inconceivable without computer science. From engineering to business management, medicine to biology, and language processing through to psychology, sociology, and archaeology – all the sciences today need computer science for the evaluation of their data. At the same time, the science of processing information by means of computer programs provides the basis for the internet and mobile telephony, for airlines and financial transactions, for DVD players, televisions, and cars that work – in short: for a functioning world. This creates a strong practical relevance, which is exactly what makes the subject so exciting and is opening up ever more employment opportunities for computer scientists. Computer Science, therefore, is a forward-looking discipline that offers excellent prospects for graduates.</p>
        
        <h3>Duration of the Course</h3>
        <p>The course lasts for 4 Years. Students are exposed to Programming Techniques, the Design and Analysis of Algorithms, basic requirements of Software Analysis, Design and Applications, and R&D activities. They are encouraged to participate in various technical contests which will help them gain better career opportunities.</p>

        <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Graduates will make contributions to the computing profession and apply computational solutions to solve real-world problems.</li>
            <li>Graduates will successfully adapt to changes in the field of computer science.</li>
            <li>Graduates will meet or exceed the expectations of their employers and professional mentors as computer science professionals and advance in their career.</li>
            <li>Graduates who choose to pursue advanced degrees will be admitted and successfully complete their degree program.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Facilities</h3>
        <p>The department has 10 computer laboratories with 350 computer terminals connected to Windows 2003/Linux servers. All the necessary software required to carry out regular laboratory work and project work are available in the department. These facilities are exclusively for undergraduate and postgraduate students of Computer Science. 10Mbps leased line connectivity for Internet access is also available.</p>
