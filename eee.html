        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The melding of electrical and electronics engineering is of particular importance at this time because of the growing needs of automatic control in high-voltage electrical systems, power plants, and automation. The knowledge-based technological revolution that has rapidly transformed the area of electronics and its disciplines has created the need for engineers at the highest possible professional level. This is particularly true in light of the intense global competition in the field. Engineering graduates can find their place in the ever-growing industrial base in this field.</p>

        <h3>Duration of the Course</h3>
        <p>4 Years</p>

        <h3>Facilities</h3>
        <h4>Electrical</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Multimedia-enabled classrooms</li>
            <li>High-class furniture</li>
            <li>The entire college Wi-Fi enabled with classrooms designed for laptop use</li>
            <li>Well-stocked library</li>
            <li>Large collection of textbooks related to EEE subjects</li>
            <li>575 e-Book collections (DVDs/CDs)</li>
            <li>OPAC facilities provided to students</li>
            <li>350 Titles and 1944 Volumes of books related to EEE subjects</li>
            <li>11 National and 120 e-journals shared by EEE/ECE Departments</li>
            <li>Departmental Library offers specialized collections of books, journals, periodicals, and electronic resources for particular subjects</li>
            <li>The library is continuously upgraded as per the necessity of the courses and student strength. Students can also utilize the digital library available</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
        <p>The department envisions that the students of the branch become engineers of professional character equipped with a strong theoretical foundation required for critical thinking, practical engineering skills to face challenges in the field, the ability to work in a team with dignity, and all the qualities that help them accomplish their goals.</p>
        <p>More specifically, our graduates are expected:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To excel in industrial or graduate work in Electrical Engineering and allied fields</li>
            <li>To practice their professions conforming to ethical values and environmentally friendly policies</li>
            <li>To work in international and multi-disciplinary environments</li>
            <li>To successfully adapt to evolving technologies and stay current with their professions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Career Opportunities</h3>
        <p>Electrical engineers develop and oversee electrical systems and equipment. They work with everything from power grids to computers, telephones, and cars. Electronic engineers, on the other hand, look after and maintain electronic equipment. Almost all industries are highly dependent on electrical and electronic engineering. The electric/electronic industry in India has benefitted significantly from de-licensing and deregulations allowed by the government. With exposure to global players and competition, Indian companies have improved production quality and are growing to their true potential. This means better job opportunities for electronic and electrical engineering graduates. The industry has seen a reported growth of 20% and is expected to continue at the same pace in the coming years. Qualified engineers are being absorbed across industries and sectors and will continue to do so in the future.</p>
